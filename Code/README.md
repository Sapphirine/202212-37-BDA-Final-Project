# BDA Project Code

Contains the 4 Jupyter Notebooks and 2 HTML files created in the course of this project. If running the whole project, DataCleaning.ipynb should be run first to generate 
the csv necessary for the other Python visualisation. Otherwise, the notebooks are not in order. The HTML dashboards should only be viewed after all 4 Jupyter Notebooks 
have been run as they depend on csv files created in these Notebooks. All data (including this created data) is available in the data file should you not want to run the 
programs yourself, so any can be downloaded and run independantly as long as the data file is also downloaded and in the same folder.
